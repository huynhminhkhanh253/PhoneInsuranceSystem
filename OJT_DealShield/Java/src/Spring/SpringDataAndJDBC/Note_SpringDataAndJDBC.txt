***Spring Data Repositories***
- role: access databse
***Jdbc vs Hibernate***
- Hibernate is the ORM framework build on top of JDBC (lowest level to access database)
***JPA and Hibernate and how does Spring simplify database access***
- Hibernate is the ORM (object relational mappibg) framework to map java classes and object to database table
- Hinernate is the implementation of JPA, JPA helps developer to simplify hibernate configuration
-> Developers just need to focus on business logic, high level develop simply use java object and method to queries database
-> Jpa talks to Hibernate talks to JDBC talks to database
-> Reduces alot of low level code (open db connection, write query, transform data,....) and config to access databases, just by basic config and some annotations and support classes
