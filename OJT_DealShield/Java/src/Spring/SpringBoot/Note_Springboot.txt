***Purpose of SpringBoot***
- Reduces time in development and increase productivity by reduces the need of configuration and boilerplate code, deployment easily with jar file in tomcat sever
- Springboot = Spring + Embedded HTTP severs - XML configuration
- Common use to develop rest api
***How does Spring Boot simplify the setup and configuration of Spring application***
- providing pre-configured templates and including pre-setup embedded http severs, easy-to-use configuration files (application.properties)
***Auto-Configuration and Starter Dependencies:
- auto-configuration:Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added
    Example: with HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration, you dont need to manually define @Bean DataSource, @Bean EntityManager, some hibernate properties...
***Starter dependencies***
- starter dependencies is a set of a set of convenient dependency (external libraries) descriptors that you can include in your application (ex: spring-boot-starter-web: it helps us reduces the config of spring to build restfull api, spring mvc)
- dependencies of springboot config in pom.xml, pom.xml contains project info and config details
- pom.xml is like a external libraries manager, build configuration of mavens project , mavens will automatically download and install for developers dependencies define in pom.xml
