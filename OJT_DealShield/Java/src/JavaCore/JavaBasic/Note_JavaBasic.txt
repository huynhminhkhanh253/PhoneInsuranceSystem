***Scope of variables(local, instance, class)?
Example:
public class Animal{
   private static int numberOfBicycles;  // class variable, "static" keyword refer to variable apply to all instances, class scope;
   int age; // instance variable, specific of a instance;
   public void run(){
      int a = 0; // local variable, only visible in speak method
   }
}
***Relational, logical operation, explain functionality?
- Relational(<, >, <=,==,...) are used for compare two values or data
- Logical(&&, ||, !) are used for checking multiple condition
***Difference between == and .equals() and example?
- equals compares value (in heap memory) of two object, two wrapper class
- == compares address (in stack memory) of two object, two wrapper class
- *cannot use .equals for primitive data types because it is not object
